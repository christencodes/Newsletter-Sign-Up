## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

MOBILE FIRST! MOBILE FIRST! MOBILE FIRST! Many things could have been avoided if you I would have focused on the mobile design first and worked from that position. I have officially learned my lesson!

Again, mobile first. God and the universe loves those who design with mobile first in mind.
